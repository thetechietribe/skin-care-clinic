    question: "Is skin needling painful?",
    answer:
      "Our micro-needling procedure is the most comfortable on the market and does not require any anaesthetic cream.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there risk of infection?",
    answer:
      "Infection to the treated area is extremely unlikely as all skin needling procedures are carried out with sterile equipment in clinical conditions. Please follow post-procedure care advice.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do they last?",
    answer:
      "The effects of a microneedling facial normally last around four to six weeks. The better care you take of your skin, the longer you can prolong the effect.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any side effects?",
    answer:
      "Microneedling facials should have minimal side effects. That said, before you commit to a microneedling facial, be sure to check the depth of the microneedling involved.",
