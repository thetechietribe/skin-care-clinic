    question: "How long do skin peels last?",
    answer: `How long the effects of a skin-peeling facial last depends on the depth of the peel:
    A light peel typically lasts from one to two months.
    A medium-depth peel normally lasts from two to six months.
    A deep peel can last several years.`,

    question: "How long do they last?",

    answer: `FAQ ABOUT SKIN-PEELING FACIAL : 
Many people flinch from the idea of peeling as something that will ‘thin the skin’ and therefore be harmful. Do peels thin the skin? Yes. A little, and just on the very surface. But here’s why that’s not a bad thing. What a chemical peel will do is dissolve the cellular ‘glue’ that keeps old dead skin cells stuck to the surface of your face. That’s a very small thinning of the stratum corneum, the outermost layers of the epidermis. Peels reveal a fresher surface beneath, and that’s good, because that fresher surface is smoother, reflects light better, and absorbs skin products better.
People feel that ‘thinner’ skin will mean skin that is more fragile and worse protected, but because the ingredients used in chemical peels also stimulate skin repair in the lower levels of the skin, they actually thicken the dermis (the lower layer of the skin) and improve its health, so overall, your skin will be left in better shape.`,
